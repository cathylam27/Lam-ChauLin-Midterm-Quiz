        <p>I think Japan is the best place for traveling because the scenery in Japan is beautiful. In fact, the four seasons have different scenery, such as Sakura in Spring, Sunflowers in Summer, Red Maple in Autumn and Snow in Winter, which makes people feel very fresh and comfortable.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In addition, Japanese food is also very delicious, such as Ramen, Sushi, and Cakes, which people will want to eat again and again. Furthermore, Japan is a good place for shopping, because there have a lot of cosmetics and most various modern clothes for sale.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In conclusion, Japan is a great place to travel.</p>
